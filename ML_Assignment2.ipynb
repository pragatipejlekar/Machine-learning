        "\n",
        "Human learning is a process of acquiring knowledge. Our behavior, skills, values and ethics are acquired when we process information through our minds and learn. Human learning may occur as part of education, personal development or any other informal/formal training. Children learn while they play, experiment, and interact.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What different forms of human learning are there? Are there any machine learning equivalents?\n",
        "\n",
        "Humans acquire knowledge through experience either directly or shared by others. Machines acquire knowledge through experience shared in the form of past data. We have the terms, Knowledge, Skill, and Memory being used to define intelligence. Just because you have good memory, that does not mean you are intelligent. And just because you are intelligent, it does not mean you should have a good memory. However, there are exceptions to these rules. Humans begin learning by memorizing.\n",
        "Both humans and machines make mistakes in applying their intelligence in solving problems. In ML, overfitting memorizes all examples and an overfitted model lacks generalization and it fails to work on never seen before examples. In most of the Asian countries, the education system does overfitting of students by over coaching and tuitions on technical subjects enabling them to solve only example problems. These example problems are answered in examinations without need for applying any intelligence. These students can solve the problems which they have already seen and only the problems seen by them in the past. They are not able to handle general problems properly with accuracy because their intelligence is not generalized. This is the major reason for missing skill levels among university recruits. In short, vast majority of students become overfitted learning models and their employability is in question.\n",

        "In ML, Transfer Learning is a technique that reuses a model that was created by machine learning experts and that has already been trained on a large dataset.\n",
        " Machine intelligence is limited to the areas in which they are trained. But human intelligence is independent of his domain of training. An intelligent human being will be able to solve problems related to unforeseen domains, whereas a machine will not be able to do that.\n",

Machine learning comprises a group of computational algorithms that can perform pattern recognition, classification, and prediction on data by learning from existing data (training set).\n",
        "\n",
        "ii. Studying under supervision\n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well \"labelled\" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.\n",
        "\n",
        "In supervised learning, the training data provided to the machines work as the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly. \n",

        "iii. Studying without supervision\n",
        "\n",
        "Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of the machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns, and differences without any prior training of data. \n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine. Therefore the machine is restricted to find the hidden structure in unlabeled data by itself. \n",

        "iv. Reinforcement learning is a form of learning based on positive reinforcement.\n",
        "\n",
